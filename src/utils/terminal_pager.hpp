/**
 * Terminal pager that displays output written to stdout one page at a time, allowing the user to
 * interactively scroll up and down. If cout is not a tty or the output is shorter than a single
 * terminal page it does nothing.
 *
 * It expects all of cout to be written before the first page is displayed, so it does not pipe from
 * cout which would be a more complicated implementation allowing the first page to be displayed
 * before all of the output is written. This may need to be reconsidered if we need more performant
 * handling of slow subcommands such as `git2cpp log` of repos with long histories.
 *
 * Keys handled:
 *     d, space                   scroll down a page
 *     u                          scroll up a page
 *     q                          quit pager
 *     down arrow, enter, return  scroll down a line
 *     up arrow                   scroll up a line
 *
 * Emits a BEL (ASCII 7) for unrecognised keys or attempts to scroll too far, which is used by some
 * terminals for visual and/or audible feedback.
 *
 * Does not respond to a change of terminal size whilst it is waiting for input, but it will the
 * next time the output is scrolled.
